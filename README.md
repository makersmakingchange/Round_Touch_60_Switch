 # Round Touch 60 Switch

<!--- 
SUMMARY
A brief summary of the project. What it does, who it is for, how much it costs.
 --->
The Round Touch 60 Switch can control 3.5mm Audio outputs like in the Xbox Adaptive Controller and other switch adapted products. The cost in part per unit is around $6 USD and it requires no programming. This device may help users with limited hand strength and dexterity that find it challenging to press mechanical switches. 

Download the attached pdf for the parts list, wiring schematic, 3D printing files, and other project notes.

## How to Obtain a Round Touch 60 Switch
### 1. Do it Yourself (DIY) or Do it Together (DIT)

This is an open-source assistive technology, so anyone is free to build it. All of the files and instructions required to build a Round Touch 60 Switch are contained within this repository. Refer to the Maker Checklist below.

### 2. Request a build of this device

If you would like to obtain a Round Touch 60 Switch , you may submit a build request through the [MMC Library Page](https://makersmakingchange.com/project/round-touch-60-switch/). The requestor is responsible for the cost of materials and any shipping.

### 3. How to build this device for someone else

If you have the skills and equipment to build this device, and would like to donate your time to create the switch for someone who needs it, visit the [MMC Maker Wanted](https://makersmakingchange.com/maker-wanted/) section.


## Getting Started
<!--- 
Include an overall idea of what major steps are required to build the device.
 --->

### 1. Order the Off-The-Shelf Components
The [Bill of Materials](/Documentation/Round_Touch_60_Switch_BOM.xlsx) lists all of the parts and components required to build a Round Touch 60 Switch. The electronic components may be available locally, but will probably need to be ordered online. 

### 2. Print the 3D Printable components
Print the components for the switch tester case and choose an option for the case.

All of the files and individual print files can be in the [/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files](/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files/) folder.

### 3. Assemble the Round Touch 60 Switch 
Reference the [assembly guide](/Documentation/Round_Touch_60_Switch_Assembly_Guide.pdf) for the tools and steps required to build each portion.
