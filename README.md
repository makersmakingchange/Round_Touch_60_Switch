 # Round Touch 60 Switch

<!---  SUMMARY A brief summary of the project. What it does, who it is for, how much it costs.  --->
The Round Touch 60 Switch is an assistive switch that is activated by touching the top surface. This device may help users with limited hand strength and dexterity that find it challenging to activate standard mechanical switches. 

It has a standard 3.5Â mm output jack, and it can be used with with standard switch adapted devices, like switch adapted toys; computer, phone, and tablet switch interfaces; and adapted gaming devices. This switch is compatible with adapted gaming controllers like the Xbox Adaptive Controller, Hori Flex Controller, and the Sony PlayStation Access Controller. 

The Round Touch 60 Switch is comprised of 3D printed parts and off-the-shelf electronics. It is based on the TTP223 Capacitive Touch boards. Assemblying the switch requires some soldering and some simple mechanical asssembly. No programming is required.

The cost of materials for a single unit is about $12 CAD, however the total cost may be quite a bit more due to several components only being available in packages of larger quantities.

## How to Obtain a Round Touch 60 Switch
### 1. Do it Yourself (DIY) or Do it Together (DIT)
This is an open-source assistive technology, so anyone is free to build it. All of the files and instructions required to build a Round Touch 60 Switch are contained within this repository. Refer to the Maker Checklist below.

### 2. Request a build of this device
If you would like to obtain a Round Touch 60 Switch , you may submit a build request through the [MMC Library Page](https://makersmakingchange.com/project/round-touch-60-switch/). The requestor is responsible for the cost of materials and any shipping.

### 3. How to build this device for someone else
If you have the skills and equipment to build this device, and would like to donate your time to create the switch for someone who needs it, visit the [MMC Maker Wanted](https://makersmakingchange.com/maker-wanted/) section.


## Getting Started
<!---  Include an overall idea of what major steps are required to build the device.  --->

### 1. Order the Off-The-Shelf Components
The [Bill of Materials](/Documentation/Round_Touch_60_Switch_BOM.xlsx) lists all of the parts and components required to build a Round Touch 60 Switch. The electronic components may be available locally, but will probably need to be ordered online. 

### 2. Print the 3D Printable components
Print the components for the switch. All of the files and individual print files can be in the [/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files](/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files/) folder.

### 3. Assemble the Round Touch 60 Switch 
Reference the [assembly guide](/Documentation/Round_Touch_60_Switch_Assembly_Guide.pdf) for the tools and steps required to build each portion.

## Files
<!--- FILES This section includes all the information and files required to build and modify the device, including documentation, design files, and build files. --->
